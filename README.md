- [ ] Create different file formats, with generated content for example: Markdown, JSON
- [ ] Custom prompts
- [ ] CLI prompts, interactivity

## Usage

Once installed, you can run `releasecraftsman` from the terminal to start fetching and formatting git logs with GPT
Below are the available options and commands.

### Generate release notes, with compacted git logs with specific version, commit logs from last tag to recent commit using GPT4
```bash
releasecraftsman -f compact -s v1.0.0 -k API_KEY -m Gpt_4 -v1.0.1 
```

You can customize it and use *GPT_3_5Turbo* model, you need to use your own, or companies API_KEY.

  
#### Options
#### 1. Default Compact Format

This will run the program using the default 'compact' format for git logs for latest 5 commit logs

```bash
releasecraftsman
```

#### 2. Specify a Format
Choose between 'compact' and 'hard' formats for the git logs.
```bash
releasecraftsman -f hard
```
#### 3. Specify Start and End Tags
Fetch git logs between specified start and end tags.

```bash
releasecraftsman -s v1.0 -e v1.2
```
This will defaultly formats in compact mode, if you want hard format

```bash
releasecraftsman -f hard -s v1.0 -e v1.2
```

#### 4. Specify Start Tag Only
Fetch git logs from the specified start tag to the latest commit.

```bash
releasecraftsman -s v1.0
```

## Installation

### From Source

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tornikegomareli/releasecraftsman.git
```

Navigate into the project directory and compile.

#### With Cargo

To compile and install using Cargo, ensure you have [Cargo installed](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) on your machine. 

Then run the following commands:
```bash
cd releasecraftsman
cargo build --release
```

After building, you'll find the executable in the `target/release` directory. You'll need to include this in your PATH in your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc` file:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/target/release
```
Reload your shell or run 

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```
or

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```
for bash users, to update your PATH.

#### With Makefile

Alternatively, you can compile using the provided Makefile, it still uses cargo, so you still need to have cargo on your machine.
So you need to follow above steps.

```bash
cd releasecraftsman
make
```

This will move the `releasecraftsman` executable to `/usr/local/bin`. You can modify the Makefile to place it in a different location if you prefer.

### With Homebrew

If you're on macOS, you can also install using Homebrew:

```bash
brew tap tornikegomareli/homebrew-releasecraftsman
brew install releasecraftsman
```

Currently releasecraftsman is not on official homebrew, but soon will be.
Also it will be soon on popular package managers for different OS's, its not only designed for mac.

### From Compiled Binary

Compiled binaries are also available for download from the [Releases](https://github.com/tornikegomareli/release-craftsman/releases) section on GitHub.
